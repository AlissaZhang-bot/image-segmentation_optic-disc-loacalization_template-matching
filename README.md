# Image Segmentation: optic disc from retinal images

##### Implement a new method for optic disc localization in retinal images. I use optic disc of nine retinal images in IDRiD dataset to extract the histograms of each colour component. Then, i calculate the average of histograms for each colour as template for localizing the centre of optic disc. Corresponding with image pre-processing and post-processing, optimize this new method to get a better result.
